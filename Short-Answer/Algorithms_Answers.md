#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Polynomial O(n^3) because the the runtime will grow at a higher rate than the input. when a = 2 then n = 3 until they equal each other then maybe it would become Linear O(n)?


b) This is Polynomial O(n^2) because there is a for loop and you are adding the outside loops O(n) as well as the inner while loop's O(n) so that would give you O(n^2)


c) Logrithmic O(log n) since your output would descrease by 1 everytime the run time should be a little slower than the input each time. 

## Exercise II


binary search tree 

chose a starting point in the middle floor. If the floor ends up being your target then return floor number. If the egg breaks go down one floor, if it doesnt break go up one floor. The target is the highest floor without the egg breaking. This recursive approach would be Logarithmic O(log n) because the output is getting smaller and smaller with each iteration.
